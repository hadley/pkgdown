\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Path to source package.}

\item{path}{Location in which to save website, relative to package
path.}

\item{examples}{Run examples?}

\item{run_dont_run}{Run examples that are surrounded in \\dontrun?}

\item{mathjax}{Use mathjax to render math symbols?}

\item{preview}{If \code{TRUE}, will preview freshly generated site}

\description{
\code{build_site()} is a convenient wrapper around four functions:
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{build_articles}()}
  \item \code{\link{build_home}()}
  \item \code{\link{build_reference}()}
  \item \code{\link{build_news}()}
}
See the documentation for the each function to learn how to control
that aspect of the site.

\section{YAML config}{


There are four top-level YAML settings that affect the entire site:

\describe{
 \item{title}{Site title, used in page title and default navbar.}
 \item{assets_path}{Path to directory of additional assets to be
   copied into root directory of site. Use this when you want complete
   control over the visual design of the site. Recommended for advanced
   users only.}
 \item{template_path}{Path to directory of templates. Override the
   default (the templates built-in to pkgdown) to completely
   control the display of your site. Recommended for advanced users
   only.}
 \item{template}{Additional metadata to be passed on to the template.
    The default template supports \code{bootswatch} to customise the
    overall theme with a bootswatch theme. You can see a complete list
    and preview how they look at
    \url{https://gallery.shinyapps.io/117-shinythemes/}.}
}

You can also control the \code{navbar}. It uses the same syntax as
\href{RMarkdown}{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html#site_navigation}.
The following YAML snippet illustrates some of the most important features.

\preformatted{
navbar:
  type: inverse
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "Reference"
      href: reference/index.html
    - text: "Articles"
      menu:
        - text: "Heading 1"
        - text: "Article A"
          href: articles/page_a.html
        - text: "Article B"
          href: articles/page_b.html
        - text: "---------"
        - text: "Heading 2"
        - text: "Article C"
          href: articles/page_c.html
        - text: "Article D"
          href: articles/page_d.html
  right:
    - icon: fa-github fa-lg
      href: https://example.com
}


Use \code{type} to choose between "default" and "inverse" themes.

You position elements by placing under either \code{left} or \code{right}.
Components can contain sub-\code{menu}s with headings (indicated by missing
\code{href}) and separators. Currently pkgdown only supports fontawesome
icons. You can see a full list of options at
\url{http://fontawesome.io/icons/}.
