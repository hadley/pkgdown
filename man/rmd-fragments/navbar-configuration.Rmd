By default, the top navbar will contain links to:

-   "Get Started", if you have an article with the same name as the package (e.g., `vignettes/pkgdown.Rmd`).
-   The reference index.
-   Articles (i.e., vignettes, if present).
-   News (if present).
-   An icon linking to the source repository.

You can override (and even remove) these defaults with the `navbar` field.
It has two primary components: `structure` and `components`.
These components interact in a somewhat complicated way, but the complexity allows you to make minor tweaks to part of the navbar while relying on pkgdown to automatically generate the rest.

The `structure` defines the layout of the navbar, i.e. the order of the components, and whether they're right aligned or left aligned.
You can use this component to change the order of the default components, remove some default components and add your own components.

    navbar:
     structure:
       left:  [intro, reference, articles, tutorials, news]
       right: [github]

The `components` describes the appearance of each element in the navbar.
It uses the same syntax as [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html#site-navigation).
The following YAML snippet illustrates some of the most important features.

    navbar:
     components:
       articles:
        text: Articles
        menu:
        - text: Category A
        - text: Title A1
          href: articles/a1.html
        - text: Title A2
          href: articles/a2.html
        - text: -------
        - text: "Category B"
        - text: Title B1
          menu:
          - text: "Sub-category B11"
            href: articles/b11.html
        twitter:
          icon: "fab fa-twitter fa-lg"
          href: https://twitter.com/hadleywickham

Components can contain sub-`menu`s with headings (indicated by missing `href`) and separators (indicated by a bunch of `-`).
You can also use `icon`s from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).

This yaml would override the default "articles" component, and add a new "twitter" component.
Unless you explicitly mention new components in the `structure` they'll be added to the far right of the left menu.
