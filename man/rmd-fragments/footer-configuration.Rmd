# YAML config - footer

By default, the footer is automatically populated with:

* the names of the
[authors `authors`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_home.html#yaml-config-authors),
on the left;
* a reference to pkgdown `pkgdown`, on the right.

The example below puts the authors information on the right together with
a legal disclaimer, and puts pkgdown on the left.
Unlike for the navbar or sidebar, components of the footer left/right are
just pasted together into a string.
If you want to use paragraphs, you need to use either HTML;
or a YAML pipe and to start the components with two empty lines.

```
footer:
 left:
   structure: [pkgdown]
 right:
   structure: [authors, legal]
   components:
     legal: Provided without ***any warranty***.
```
