## Authors

By default, pkgdown will display information related to authors in three places

* the sidebar;
* the footer left part;
* the author page.

Both the sidebar and footer are customizable so you could move the authors 
information or remove it entirely from them, see the sidebar and footer docs
in respectively `?build_home` and `?build_footer`

Author ORCID identification numbers in the `DESCRIPTION` are linked using the ORCID logo:

```
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", , "hadley@rstudio.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-4757-117X")
    ),
    person("Jay", "Hesselberth", role = "aut",
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-6299-179X")
    )
  )
```


### YAML config - authors

You can tweak two things via the `authors` YAML field:
filtering of authors for the sidebar and footer,
text before authors in the footer, and display of authors.

The "developers" list is populated by the maintainer ("cre"), authors
("aut"), and funder ("fnd") from the `DESCRIPTION`. 
You could choose other roles for filtering.
The configuration below would make

* only the maintainer and funder(s) appear in 
the footer, after the text "Crafted by".


```
authors:
  footer:
    roles: [cre, fnd]
    text: "Crafted by"
  sidebar:
    roles: [aut, ctb]
```

You can modify the authors' display on the home page and author page 
by adding a subsection for `authors`. 
Each entry in `authors` should be named 
with the author's name (matching `DESCRIPTION`)
and can contain `href` and/or `html` fields:

* If `href` is provided, the author's name will be linked to this URL.
* If `html` is provided, it will be shown instead of the author's name.
  This is particularly useful if you want to display the logo of a corporate
  sponsor.

```
authors:
  firstname lastname:
    href: "http://name-website.com"
    html: "<img src='name-picture.png' height=24>"
```
