## Authors

By default, pkgdown will display information related to authors in three places

* the sidebar;
* the footer left part;
* the author page.

Both the sidebar and footer are customizable so you could move the authors 
information or remove it entirely from them, see the sidebar and footer docs
in respectively `?build_home` and `?build_footer`

Author ORCID identification numbers in the `DESCRIPTION` are linked using the ORCID logo:

```
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", , "hadley@rstudio.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-4757-117X")
    ),
    person("Jay", "Hesselberth", role = "aut",
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-6299-179X")
    )
  )
```

### Authors bio

If you want to add more details about authors or their involvement with the package,
you can use the comment field,
that will be rendered on the authors page.

```
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", , "hadley@rstudio.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-4757-117X", "Indenter-in-chief")
    ),
    person("Jay", "Hesselberth", role = "aut",
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-6299-179X")
    )
  )
```

### YAML config - authors

You can tweak a few things via the `authors` YAML field:

* display of authors in the footer, sidebar and authors page,
* filtering of authors for the sidebar and footer,
* text before authors in the footer, 
* text before and after authors on the authors page.


You can modify the authors' display on the home page and author page 
by adding a subsection for `authors`. 
Each entry in `authors` should be named 
with the author's name (matching `DESCRIPTION`)
and can contain `href` and/or `html` fields:

* If `href` is provided, the author's name will be linked to this URL.
* If `html` is provided, it will be shown instead of the author's name.
  This is particularly useful if you want to display the logo of a corporate
  sponsor.

```
authors:
  firstname lastname:
    href: "http://name-website.com"
    html: "<img src='name-picture.png' height=24>"
```


The "developers" list is populated by the maintainer ("cre"), authors
("aut"), and funder ("fnd") from the `DESCRIPTION`. 
You could choose other roles for filtering.
With the configuration below,

* only the maintainer and funder(s) appear in 
the footer, after the text "Crafted by";
* all authors and contributors appear in the sidebar;
* the authors list on the authors page is preceded and followed by some text.


```
authors:
  footer:
    roles: [cre, fnd]
    text: "Crafted by"
  sidebar:
    roles: [aut, ctb]
  before: "This package is proudly brought to you by:"
  after: "Also refer to the [changelog](news/index.html) for more contributors. :pray:"
```

If you want to filter authors based on something else than their roles, 
consider using a custom sidebar/footer component 
(see `? build_home`/`? build_site`, respectively).
